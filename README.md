# web-API-code-quiz
In this homework assignment, we were tasked with creating a dynamic Web API Quiz using javascript. I started this projcet with three pages, HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

## Initial Set Up

To begin this project, I started with psuedo code to layout what we need to accomplish while using dynamic javascript and not heavy HTML code. This presented with an issue as this inclued multiple functions, loops and queryselectors that caused issues thoughout the week to render. 

### Issues That I Ran Into

My countdown timer was set up based off an inclass activity and for some reason it would countdown by 2 instead of one. This then turned into a bigger problem as I would continue to countdown into the negative. 

I was unable to figure out or set up the highest score screen for this project. I ran out of time to meet the turn in deadline. 

#### Resources Utilized

I worked with a tutor early this week to better understand functions and local storage. I also worked with Chris Enright and Micheal Spikes in a group to bounce ideas off of eachother through out this assignment.
